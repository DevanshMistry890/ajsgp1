why i used classes and static methods?
[instead of functional programming or regular functions exported from modules]

static methods:
- All operations are stateless and don't require instance-specific data.
- Tasks share the same JSON data source.
- There's no need for instance variables or maintaining state between operations or requests.
- Each request is handled independently, so static methods are more memory-efficient by avoiding unnecessary instantiations.

class:
- It's mostly about improving organization and clarity, not object-oriented features.
